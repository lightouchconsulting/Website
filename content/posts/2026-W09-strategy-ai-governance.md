# AI-Driven Governance: What CIOs Need This Week

Artificial intelligence governance has moved from a theoretical concern to an operational imperative. CIOs who delay building structured governance frameworks risk both regulatory exposure and competitive disadvantage.

## The Core Challenge

The challenge is not purely technical. It is organisational. AI systems span business units, data domains, and vendor relationships in ways that traditional IT governance was never designed to handle.

## What Good Looks Like

Leading organisations are establishing AI steering committees with cross-functional representation — legal, compliance, operations, and technology. They are defining clear accountability at the model level, not just the system level.

## Your Next Step

If you have not mapped which AI systems are in production, who owns them, and what decisions they influence — start there. Governance without visibility is theatre.
