# AI Governance: A CIO Checklist

Effective AI governance starts with visibility. Before you can govern AI, you need to know what AI systems are running, who owns them, and what decisions they influence.

## The Core Checklist

1. **Inventory all AI systems** in production — including third-party tools with AI features
2. **Assign clear ownership** at the model level, not just the application level
3. **Define decision boundaries** — which decisions can AI make autonomously, which require human review
4. **Establish a review cadence** — monthly for high-stakes systems, quarterly for lower-risk
5. **Document your data lineage** — know where training data came from and when it was last refreshed

## Common Failure Modes

The most common failure mode is treating AI governance as an IT problem. It is a business problem with an IT component. Sponsor it at the C-suite level.
